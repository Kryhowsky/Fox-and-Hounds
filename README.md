# Fox-and-Hounds
Project realized during studies. 

## General Information
The goal of the project is an application with a graphical user interface that allows you to play Fox and Hounds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_games). The application should have the following properties:
- convenient and intuitive way to control
- the ability to save and read the game state from a file specified by the user
- possibility of playing for two people
- the ability to limit the time allocated to the execution of a move by each player

The application should be implemented with the JavaFX library using the source code, without the help of wizards. The application should be protected against user errors or other problems (e.g. incorrect game file format when loading, etc.). As a result, all exceptions should be handled e.g. by displaying the appropriate dialog box.
